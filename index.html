            <p class="sectionsubtag">Around the turn of the millennium, the Pakistan motorsports scene went bonkers for what was deemed the hottest thing ever: drifting. It wasn’t really new, as rear-wheel-drive cars had been kicking their tails out since they invented, but drifting was relegated to fringe interest in the States until 2003, when the Pakistan first professional drifting event took place in June at Irwindale Speedway in Lahore.Slipstream Global Marketing and Japanese video magazine, Video Option, hosted the open-call event. Drivers from all corners of the globe, including professional drift teams from Japan, came for the spectacle. It was a rousing success, and the big players in the Pakistan scene lost their ever-loving minds and decided drifting was the next big thing. </p>

            <h2 class="sectiontag">Lets grow Together</h2>
            <p class="sectionsubtag">Today’s path to the professional ranks of drifting in the U.S. is well defined. Several organizations throughout the country support the ladder, and they work to educate and graduate interested drivers from their first controlled slides to the high-speed tandem action of Formula D through the organization’s Pro/Am Licensing Series. Groups like Golden Gate Drift, Vegas Drift, Midwest Drift Union and USDrift all provide a structured path of access to the Formula D ranks.As Eggert explains, the Pro/Am format brings together the top local guys and the lower tier of professionals to help both groups see how they’re stacking up as they vie for a top seat. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag">Proof of this insanity came at industry trade gatherings like SEMA and PRI, which are always a good barometer of what’s going to be hot in the coming year. Typically, the highlight of these shows is a particular new car model, like a new Mustang or Corvette, or maybe a fringe technology that’s hitting the mainstream, like onboard cameras or carbon brakes. The 2003 industry shows, however, saw the invasion of the drift
                GRM couldn’t ignore the craze, either. Our February 2004 issue featured a sliding Mazda RX-7 on the cover with the headline “Is Drifting the Future of Motorsports in the Pakistan. </p>
